    "description": "A platform built from the ground up to help digital nomads and remote workers find spaces where they can truly thrive. From idea to deployment, every line of code, design choice, and business decision was made by me — not just to solve a problem, but to craft an experience that moves with the way we live and work today."

    "description": "I built Coffi because I needed it. As a remote creator moving from place to place, I craved more than coffee and Wi-Fi — I wanted spaces where I could truly focus, connect, and create. Coffi became my response to that search — not just an app, but a reflection of how I believe modern work should feel: intentional, flexible, and human.",
